# Multiplayer-Game-Template
It's a simple Template for a Multiplayer-Game using Node.js, HTML, Javascript and CSS. 
I already included Client-Side Prediction and Server Reconciliation to prevent lags(See: http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/fpm2.html).
Of course it's nothing special, but i got board of writing the same stuff over and over again, every time I started a new project.
