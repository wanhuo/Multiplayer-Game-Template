# Multiplayer-Game-Template
It's a simple Template for a Multiplayer-Game using Node.js, HTML, Javascript and CSS. 
I already included Client-Side Prediction and Server Reconciliation to prevent lags(See: http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/fpm2.html).
Of course it's nothing special, but i got board of writing the same stuff over and over again, every time I started a new project.

How to use the project:
Simply put the folder somewhere on your computer, then launch the console or terminal. At last start the server by typing "node        The-Path-to-the-folder/server.js" into the console or terminal. Now the server should be running.
